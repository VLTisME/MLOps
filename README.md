# Introduction
This is a place for me to jot down all stuff about MLOps that I study

# This course has four parts, below is an overview for each part.

## MLOps1
### Objective
- Learn to build an end-to-end Machine Learning system—from packaging and deployment to production monitoring.
### Overview

| **Lesson**                          | **Content**                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux                              | Learn about the Linux environment, which is commonly used on servers you'll be working with.                                                             |
| Python                             | Learn how to write and understand code using Python — the main language for building ML systems.                                                         |
| Bash Scripting                     | Get familiar with command-line operations, interact with servers, and automate scripts using Cronjobs.                                                   |
| WebAPI                             | Instead of running scripts manually when data arrives, learn to send data via APIs and receive results programmatically.                                |
| Functional Testing                 | Build test files to ensure your code behaves as expected, is reliable, and is free of critical bugs.                                                     |
| Containerization & Orchestration I & II | Learn to package your code, environments, and dependencies using containers. Then, deploy across multiple machines using orchestration tools to take advantage of clusters. |
| CI/CD                              | Learn how to automate the entire process — from testing, packaging, to deploying your application — using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines. |
| Cloud Services                     | Deploy your system to cloud platforms so it's accessible to users over the internet. *(Note: You may need a VISA or debit card to use certain services.)* |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC)       | Learn how to define and manage infrastructure (like clusters or networks) using code, instead of setting it up manually.                                 |
| Observable Systems                 | Learn how to monitor your system in production, track metrics, logs, and understand how it performs in real time.


## MLOps2

### Overview
| Lesson                 | Content |
|--------------------------|----------|
| Data Architecture        | Learn the fundamentals of modern data architectures (Data Fabric, Data Mesh) and how to design systems like Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Lake Houses for large-scale data management and processing. |
| Source Systems           | Understand different types of data sources, explore how to capture changes from systems (CDC), and master key concepts of Kafka, including its architecture, offset management, partitioning, and rebalancing strategies. |
| Storage                  | Dive into various data storage technologies such as HDFS and object storage, learn about ACID properties, table partitioning techniques, and discover modern data table formats like Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Hudi. |
| Ingestion I: Batch        | Build a strong foundation in batch data ingestion by learning Spark’s architecture, its core components like DataFrame and RDD, and how to optimize large-scale data processing workflows effectively. |
| Ingestion II: Stream      | Get introduced to stream data ingestion concepts using Flink, learn about execution models, windowing, watermarks, and build real-time data pipelines with the Table API and Datastream API. |
| Pipeline Orchestration    | Master how to orchestrate complex workflows using Apache Airflow, understand how it schedules tasks beyond cronjobs, and manage data pipelines efficiently through its architecture and operators. |
| Feature Store            | Explore the concept of feature stores in machine learning systems, understand how to design feature views, and deploy platforms like Feast to manage features for model training and serving. |
